# Sales Prediction


The purpose of this project is to help the stakeholders learn about their sales data and to create a model to help predict outlet sales.
This project showcases my ability to clean data, explore data, visualize data, and then train a model to predict sales.

## Data Cleaning
There were a few issues that needed to be addressed in the dataset. One of those was filling in the missing values. 
The solution chosen for the item weight was to fill in the missing values with the average values based on the item type. 
These values below were inserted into each missing data.

This data visualization shows that regular fat items sell better than low fat items, but the low fat item outliers are higher than the regular fat items. 
## Machine Learning 
Provides a comparison between a Random Forest regression model and a KNN regression model, with Random Forest giving a more accurate model.
